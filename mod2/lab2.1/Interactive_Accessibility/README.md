# ** Lab 2.1 - Interactive Accessibility **


## ** Accessibility challenges on Implementing **
ARIA attributes are one of the more challenging aspects of accessibility for me. While semantic HTML already provides strong support for screen readers and interactive accessibility, ARIA becomes necessary for custom components such as labels, buttons, toggle switches, and sliders. However, ARIA must be used very carefully — if the properties or values are misplaced, they won’t work as intended. That’s why working with ARIA has been a challenging experience for me.

## ** Improving Accessibility with ARIA Attributes **
ARIA live regions help users who rely on assistive technologies by announcing dynamic content changes, such as opening menus, submitting files, or other updates, without requiring a page reload. They support programmable focus management and help maintain a logical flow of navigation.

## ** Color contrast tool I used **
I used the Color Contrast Analyser tool, which made it easy to pick colors from the screen and adjust values in RGB, HSL, and HSV. It also helped me quickly decide which colors to use by showing the contrast ratio results, along with accessibility scores (AA, AAA) for both regular and large text, as well as for non-text elements like UI components and objects.
